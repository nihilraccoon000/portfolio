                <p>
                    This is basically just a listing of the assignments I've done for a UI/UX class. 
                    
                    
                    <p class="lead">My confession:</p>
                    I think of myself as a bad design lover who would constantly check back at a stream 
                    where this genious VTuber introduced himself with a terrible PowerPoint
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iQvT8Xmess"><img src="./assets/images/shellin.png" style="width: 17vh; vertical-align: bottom;"></a> 
                    I laugh so hard everytime I watch it. 
                    <br><br>
                    <font size="1pt;" color="#333333">For the sake of maintaining the unthoughtful joy, 
                        it is probably not a good idea to try to analyze why I like these bad designs. But</font>
                    I guess what makes them interesting (somehow funny, but also nostalgic and cute) to me 
                    is how they dump nowadays aesthetics and embrace the outdated ones. 
                    I am forgetful, I tend to take the modern, industrial styles around me for granted. Without looking at these "bad designs", it is hard to notice how much <em>design</em> as whole (including aesthetics, usability, etc.) has evolved throughout the past 10 to 20 years.

                    <br><br>To produce good (up-to-date) designs is not that easy. I am, after all, not yet a good designer and definitely not a talented one. 
                    In this portfolio, you'll find 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            some <em>practice</em> on some common <em>practices</em> in UI/UX design
                        </li>
                        <li>inmature efforts to improve the usability of an outdated website</li>
                        <li>more inmature efforts to design a prototype</li>
                        <li>a website for my favorite character, plus the invisible struggles to make it fairly usable and not too ugly (but also not too "modern", though it should hardly be my concern)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Last words: I know this introduction somehow represents a bad design itself, so thanks for bearing with me. If you're still interested after reading this wordy intro, without further ado, scroll down and take a look at the projects :)

                        Iterative design of an interactive interface for the startup Dumme, whose goal is to index videos with cutting edge AI models, make finding info in video as easy as Cmd+F on a web page.
                    <br><br>
                        It was kind of hard to mock the idea with prototypes. 
                        It seems like the actual implementation of the interface would involve a lot of js tricks.

                        Redesigning an outdated, not very usable website. 
                        It was the site that I constantly checked during my Japanese culture class. 
                        I tried to make it look like one of those online reading app with a paper-like background, 
                        changed the eye-harming high contrast theme and stripped down all unnecessary (at least imo) elements.

                        I've always wanted a website where I can easily sort and filter and see the stats of all the cards, so I made this. 
                        <br><br>Currently it only contains cards of my favorite characters, so I use her color as the theme color. The usability was OK. I'm still working on extending it.
